# Acceleromate
by Ilgam Gabdullin

### Why 
Experimental (!) project for fooling around with sockets, device orientation events and canvas (may be switched to svg by now, may be other technologies are here too);

### How
` npm start`  - builds front stuff, puts it to ` /build ` folder and starts express server to serve api and front
` npm run build ` - just builds front
` npm run dev ` - runs webpack-dev-server for getting pleasure (in other words - developing)

### Awesome
I know
