# Acceleromate
by Ilgam Gabdullin

### What 
Experimental (!) project for fooling around with sockets, device orientation events and canvas (may be switched to svg by now, may be other technologies are here too);  
Open the app on mobile and desktop (direct your phone into desktop under 90 degrees!) - you are going to see blue dot following your phone direction

### How
` npm start`  - starts express server to serve api and front  
` npm run build ` - just builds front  
` npm run dev ` - runs webpack-dev-server for getting pleasure (or developing - same)  

### Where
You can clone and play with app on local, or this app also lives on heroku severs https://acceleromate.herokuapp.com/

### Awesome
I know
